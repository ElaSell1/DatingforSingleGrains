File Information: 
This is an example Eccel file with the results from Analyst for sample CPJB_L11. The data in the spreadsheet is used for subsequent analysis and eventual age determination. 

Methodology: 
Single grain discs were loaded with 100 grains and measured on a Risø TL/OSL reader at RenDal laboratory at Univeristé de Rennes. 
Grains were stimulated with green light, and OSL detected through a Hoya U-340 and a Schott BG-39 blue filter pack. 
Raw OSL measurement data is stored automatically via the Risø reader software, as .BINX files. The results of this initial analysis was then copied and pasted into Excel.
