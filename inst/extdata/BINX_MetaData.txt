Methodology: 
Single grain discs were loaded with 100 grains and measured on a Risø TL/OSL reader at RenDal laboratory at Univeristé de Rennes. 
Grains were stimulated with green light, and OSL detected through a Hoya U-340 and a Schott BG-39 blue filter pack. 
Raw OSL measurement data is stored automatically via the Risø reader software, as .BINX files.
